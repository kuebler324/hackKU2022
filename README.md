# hackKU2022
Binary to Decimal Game (Title is WIP)

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING

	On the GitHub code section, click green Code drop down button and download "hackKU2022-main.zip".

	Go to file location, right click on the .zip and extract it. 

	Open the hackKU2022-main folder until you see the html, js, and css files.


	To run the game with audio when hosted locally, we must setup a server (see instructions below). 
	If the game is not locally hosted (on its own website domain), then we don't need to setup the server because it is already setup for the website. 

	Windows 10
		in the "hackKU2022-main" folder, hold Shift key and right click on empty space to bring up special options.
		Click "Open PowerShell window here"
		in the powershell command line, type "python -m http.server"
		Then, open browser of choice (I chose Edge), and go to url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
		Now the game works with audio!

	Windows 11
		in the "hackKU2022-main" folder, right click on empty space to bring up options.
		Click "Open in Windows terminal"
		in the powershell command line, type "python -m http.server"
		Then, open browser of choice (I chose Edge), and go to url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
		Now the game works with audio!

		To end the server, you can press Ctrl + C in the powershell command line, or simply close the powershell window.
